## What is here

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `svg/go-typeset.svg` | **the source of truth** — 256×256, `rx=56` rounded square, diagonal gradient, white line glyph |
| `png/color/<size>/go-typeset.png` | rasterised at 16, 32, 48, 64, 88, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 px |
| `jpg/<size>/go-typeset.jpg` | the same sizes, flattened onto white (JPEG has no alpha) |
| `avatar/go-typeset.png` | 512 px, for the org avatar |
| `ico/go-typeset.ico` | Windows icon |
| `icns/go-typeset.icns` | macOS icon |
| `social/go-typeset.png` | 1280x640 social preview: full-bleed gradient, glyph at 2x |

## The mark

The glyph is four set lines, the last one short: a justified paragraph, which is what a line breaker produces. The gradient is the indigo of go-tex, its sibling in the text family: a family colour is shared, not invented per org.

## How the PNGs are made

By **[go-gfx/gfx](https://github.com/go-gfx/gfx)**, this fleet's own pure-Go
rasteriser, plus the standard library's PNG encoder — no Python, no Pillow, no
`sips`, no `iconutil`:

```
brandkit svg/go-typeset.svg .
```

Rasterising these logos is what surfaced the gaps that
[go-gfx/gfx#12](https://github.com/go-gfx/gfx/pull/12) fixed: the rasteriser
understood fills only, so **208 of this fleet's 263 org logos came out as flat
squares** — a gradient it could not read was silently replaced by the inherited
black. Gradients, strokes and `rect rx` were added there rather than worked
around here.

The **social banner** is the mark on a full-bleed gradient with the glyph at 2x:
a preview is shown small, and a banner must never be white-backed because it is
seen against both light and dark chrome. It carries **no wordmark** — text would
need glyph outlines, and `go-opentype` keeps `glyphContours` private, so the org
name is deliberately absent rather than approximated.
